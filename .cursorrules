- You are also proficient in DevOps practices, ensuring that the solution integrates seamlessly with GitHub's ecosystem.
- You are recognized for designing scalable, maintainable, and human-in-the-loop automation systems.

# Technology Stack

- **Type Hinting:** Use the `typing` module; all functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations.
- **Testing Framework:** pytest
- **Documentation:** Google style docstrings
- **Environment Management:** Poetry
- **LLM/API Providers:** OpenAI GPT-4 (preferred); alternative options include Anthropic Claude
- **GitHub Integration:** GitHub REST API
- **Static Analysis Tools (Optional):** Pylint, flake8
- **Version Control:** git
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Python logging module, GitHub Actions artifacts for logs

# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Pythonic Practices

- **Readability & Simplicity:** Write code that is clear, concise, and easy to maintain.
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Follow PEP 8 guidelines; use Ruff for code formatting.
- **Explicit is Better than Implicit:** Clearly declare variables, functions, and their purposes.
- **Docstrings:** All functions, methods, and classes must include detailed Google-style docstrings with usage examples and type annotations.

## 2. Modular & Maintainable Design

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/file should focus on one primary function.
- **Reusable Components:** Write functions and classes that can be reused across the project.
- **Clear Package Structure:** Organize code into logical packages (e.g., `agents`, `github_integration`, `utils`).

## 3. Code Quality & Testing

- **Type Annotations:** All code must include explicit type annotations.
- **Unit Testing:** Achieve high test coverage using pytest, including edge cases.
- **Exception Handling:** Use specific exceptions with informative error messages. Avoid bare except clauses.
- **Logging:** Use the Python logging module to record critical events and errors.

## 4. AI & LLM Specific Guidelines

- **Prompt Engineering:** Maintain a dedicated module for managing LLM prompt templates and versioning them.
- **Multi-Agent Interaction:** Clearly delineate the responsibilities of the Review Agent and Refinement Agent.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Design workflows to include human verification (using GitHub's native "resolve" feature) for each review comment.
- **Tool Integration:** Use modular functions to wrap calls to external tools (LLMs, GitHub API) for clarity and reusability.

## 5. GitHub Events & Webhooks

- **Event Listeners:** Set up webhook listeners for relevant GitHub events (labels for respective agents)
- **Environment Variables & Secrets:** Manage API keys and tokens securely using GitHub Secrets or environment variables.
- **Error Reporting:** Ensure webhook handlers log errors comprehensively and, where possible, fail gracefully with actionable messages.

## 6. GitHub Integration & Automation

- **API Calls:** Use the GitHub REST API for retrieving PR diffs, posting inline review comments, retrieving comment resolution statuses, and committing code changes.
- **Review Comments Handling:** Implement automated resolution of comments once actioned. Use GitHub's "resolve conversation" feature to avoid reprocessing.
- **Tracking:** Consider embedding metadata in comments (e.g., comment IDs) or using GitHub's native features to track which suggestions have been processed.

## Overview

1. **Review Phase:**
   - **Trigger:** GitHub webhook events (e.g., label assigned to review).
   - **Process:** The Review Agent retrieves the PR diff using the GitHub API, calls GPT-4 with a "Code Review" prompt, and generates inline review comments. Each comment is posted immediately via a tool call to GitHub.
   - **Human-in-the-Loop:** The human reviewer inspects the inline comments and, if a suggestion is deemed unnecessary, marks the corresponding conversation as "resolved".

2. **Refinement Phase:**
   - **Trigger:** GitHub webhook events (e.g., label assigned to refine).
   - **Process:** The Refinement Agent retrieves all inline review comments along with their resolution status. It filters out any resolved comments and processes the remaining ones by calling GPT-4 with a "Code Refinement" prompt (optionally with additional tools for test generation). Approved suggestions are incorporated into the code, which is then committed via the GitHub API. Once changes are committed, the agent resolves the associated review comments automatically.
   - **Iteration:** The process repeats until the Review Agent finds no further unresolved suggestions.

# Additional Guidelines

- Keep each component (Review Agent, Refinement Agent, GitHub integration, LLM wrapper, and Tools) as independent, well-documented modules.
- Use YAML or JSON configuration files to manage team-specific settings (e.g., coding standards, prompt templates) and store secret tokens securely via GitHub Secrets.
- Implement detailed logging for API calls and agent actions to facilitate debugging and iterative improvement.
- Ensure error handling is robust; API failures or unexpected LLM responses should be handled gracefully with retries or clear error messages.
- Document the project structure, usage instructions, and workflow details in a README file within your repository.
- Use Sagar Shroff as author name wherever required.
- Do not use pip to install packages directly, use poetry instead.
- Do not manually add any dependency, always use poetry.
- Always run the the programs using poetry. Do not run those programs directly without using poetry or else they might not be recognized.
- Never push changes directly to the master/main branch. Always create a new branch with a descriptive name that reflects the work being done (e.g., `feature/review-agent`, `fix/github-api-integration`, `refactor/prompt-templates`) and submit a pull request for review before merging.

# Development Process Guidelines

## Incremental Implementation Approach

- Always proceed with small, incremental steps when implementing new features
- Present one logical component at a time for review before proceeding to the next step
- Wait for explicit approval before moving forward with implementation
- Label each step clearly and indicate dependencies or connections to other components
- Discuss design considerations and alternatives before implementation

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow all coding guidelines specified in custom instructions
- Maintain consistent code style and documentation standards
- Ensure all new components have appropriate unit tests
- Document design decisions and component interactions

## Review Process

- Submit small, focused changes for review
- Explain the rationale behind implementation choices
- Highlight any potential issues or alternative approaches
- Respond to feedback and incorporate suggestions
