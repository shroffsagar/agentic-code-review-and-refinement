# Agentic Code Review and Refinement System

A sophisticated AI-powered system for automated code review and refinement, integrating with GitHub's ecosystem to provide intelligent code analysis and improvement suggestions.

## System Design

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture and workflow of the Agentic Code Review and Refinement System:

## User Workflow

1. Developer opens a Pull Request
2. Developer manually triggers the Review Agent workflow from GitHub Actions
3. Review Agent analyzes the PR and adds inline review comments
4. Developer reviews the AI-generated comments and approves/rejects them
5. Developer manually triggers the Refinement Agent workflow
6. Refinement Agent implements approved suggestions and commits changes

## Current Status

The project has completed Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure Setup) and is well into Phase 2 (Minimal Agent Validation). We have established the core GitHub App infrastructure, including:

- GitHub App setup with proper authentication and webhook handling
- PR state management and context handling system
- Base agent structure for review and refinement operations
- Decorator-based operation management
- Logging and configuration systems

Currently working on:
1. Implementing the Review Agent's core functionality for PR analysis
2. Integrating GPT-4 for intelligent code review
3. Building the comment management system

Next major milestone: Complete the Review Agent implementation to enable automated code review on PRs.
