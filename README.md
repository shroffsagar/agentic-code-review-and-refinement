# Agentic Code Review and Refinement System

A sophisticated AI-powered system for automated code review and refinement, integrating with GitHub's ecosystem to provide intelligent code analysis and improvement suggestions.

## System Design

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture and workflow of the Agentic Code Review and Refinement System:

## User Workflow

1. Developer opens a Pull Request
2. Developer manually triggers the Review Agent workflow from GitHub Actions
3. Review Agent analyzes the PR and adds inline review comments
4. Developer reviews the AI-generated comments and approves/rejects them
5. Developer manually triggers the Refinement Agent workflow
6. Refinement Agent implements approved suggestions and commits changes

## Current Status

The project has completed Phases 1-3, establishing a fully functional Review Agent system. Key components include:

- GitHub App infrastructure with authentication and webhook handling
- PR state management and context handling system
- Base agent structure for review operations
- Decorator-based operation management
- Logging and configuration systems
- LLM integration with OpenAI's GPT-4
- Structured review comment formatting
- End-to-end PR review process with comment posting

Currently working on:
1. Beginning implementation of the Refinement Agent (Phase 4)
2. Expanding test coverage with integration tests

Next major milestone: Implement the Refinement Agent to automatically apply approved suggestions from code reviews.
