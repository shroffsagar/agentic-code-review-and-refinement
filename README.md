# Agentic Code Review and Refinement System

A sophisticated AI-powered system for automated code review and refinement, integrating with GitHub's ecosystem to provide intelligent code analysis and improvement suggestions.

## System Design

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture and workflow of the Agentic Code Review and Refinement System:

## User Workflow

1. Developer opens a Pull Request
2. Developer manually triggers the Review Agent workflow from GitHub Actions
3. Review Agent analyzes the PR and adds inline review comments
4. Developer reviews the AI-generated comments and approves/rejects them
5. Developer manually triggers the Refinement Agent workflow
6. Refinement Agent implements approved suggestions and commits changes

## Project Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup (Completed)
- [x] Project structure initialization
- [x] Development environment configuration
- [x] Dependency management setup with `Poetry`
- [x] Code quality tools integration (Ruff)
- [x] Type hinting and documentation standards
- [x] Testing framework setup with pytest
- [x] Logging system implementation
- [x] CI/CD pipeline setup with GitHub Actions
- [x] Artifact management and storage

### Phase 2: Minimal Agent Validation
- [ ] Basic GitHub API integration for PR access
- [ ] Simple agent implementation that can:
  - [ ] Access PR content
  - [ ] Make a basic API call to GPT-4
  - [ ] Post a test comment on the PR
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for manual agent triggering
- [ ] Basic error handling and logging
- [ ] Test PR creation and agent interaction

### Phase 3: Agent Structure and Workflow
- [ ] Agent system implementation
  - [ ] Review Agent structure and GitHub integration
  - [ ] Refinement Agent structure and GitHub integration
  - [ ] Comment management using GitHub's native system:
    - [ ] Review Agent posts inline comments on PR
    - [ ] Refinement Agent processes each comment sequentially
    - [ ] Automatic comment resolution after code changes

### Phase 4: LLM Integration
- [ ] Core LLM Infrastructure
  - [ ] OpenAI GPT-4 client setup with secure authentication
  - [ ] Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
  - [ ] Token usage monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Prompt Management System
  - [ ] Modular prompt templates for review and refinement
  - [ ] Context-aware prompt generation
  - [ ] Response validation and parsing

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Test generation for code changes
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced code analysis features

### Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit test suite
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security testing

### Phase 7: Documentation and Production Readiness
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guides
- [ ] Deployment guides
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Production environment configuration

## Current Status

The project is currently in Phase 2 (Minimal Agent Validation), focusing on validating the core agent functionality. This phase will help us confirm that the basic workflow of triggering agents from GitHub PRs is feasible before proceeding with the full implementation.
